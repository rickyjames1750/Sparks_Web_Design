<p class="dark">"I had set out to build a more connected world, and with that I realized how technolgy can elevate us further. I build sites for the love of giving those the ability to change the world at a small or large scale. Having an online presence is critical for any business. People want to be able to see what time a place is open, if it has free wifi, and what are the prices. They want to pre-examine a location their going to before they go. This new luxury of having your business on google and many social media sites can make or break your business."<br>~Ricky Sparks</p>
